# The Gulag Archipelago Audiobook Information

This website is a collection of information, notes and metadata about the audiobook version of "The Gulag Archipelago" by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, published by Blackstone Audio and narrated by Frederick Davidson. The book is split into 7 files, which are then split into 3 volumes, each with multiple parts, sections, chapters and cassettes. The book is long, and the files are long, so I have included information about the timestamps of each section, as well as the duration of each file.
