    <h4 id="why-the-website-is-useful">Why the website is useful</h4>
<p>The website is useful for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Easy navigation</strong>: The website makes it easy to navigate through the book, by providing links to each section, chapter, and cassette.</li>
<li><strong>Timestamps</strong>: The website includes timestamps for each section, chapter, and cassette, making it easy to jump to a specific part of the book.</li>
<li><strong>Durations</strong>: The website includes the duration of each file, making it easier to plan when you want to listen to the book.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>: The website includes a search function, making it easy to find specific parts of the book.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="how-the-website-was-created">How the website was created</h4>
<p>The website was created using a combination of Python, Markdown, and MkDocs. I have manually entered all the timestamp information as well as all quotes that stood out to me into the markdown files for the website, and then the Python code was used to generate the HTML for the website. The Markdown files were converted to HTML using MkDocs.</p>
<p>The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, and is automatically updated whenever I make a change to the code or data.</p>
<h4 id="how-you-can-contribute">How you can contribute</h4>

<p>I am also open to contributions of additional data, such as summaries of each section, chapter, or cassette, or additional notes about the book. Please let me know if you have any ideas.</p>
