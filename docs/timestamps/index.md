#### Timestamps

This three volume masterpiece is split across 7 files, and is summarized by Cassettes, Chapters, Parts, Sections and Volumes respectively. All timestamps for the various First Chapters include the preface.

The Durations for each file are also available per File. A few of the recordings are not stitched together properly, and so I have included the start and end times of the missing pieces. Finally, I have listed the timestamps for some of more prominent quotes throughout the entire series, as well as some quotes which have struck me personally.
